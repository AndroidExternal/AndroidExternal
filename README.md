What is Android/External?
-------------------------
Android/External is a project that aims to update and improve many of the projects found in AOSP's external directory.

Why use Android/External?
-------------------------
The same reason you update software on your computer! Many of the updates we include contain security patches, bug fixes, performance improvements, and general enhancements. That being said, there can be drawbacks. These changes are not officially supported by AOSP (though some are from AOSP's master branch), so they may cause instability or problems on some platforms.
